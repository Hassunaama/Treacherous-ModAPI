# Building:
## Windows:
Firstly you need:
- A [DiscordRPC DLL](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp/releases/tag/v1.1.3)
- The game's Treacheous Trials_Data\Managed DLL files.
- Visual Studio 2019 (I use 2022)

Then, clone the repository to your computer, and open the .sln file in the repository's root folder. now, add the DLL file assembly's, that was listed.

After that, you can run ``` dotnet build ``` on the CMD, with the CMD open on the repository's root folder.
